    "#### Matrix Calculation of Self-Attention\n",
    "- The first step is to calculate the Query, Key, and Value matrices. We do that by packing our embeddings into a matrix X, and multiplying it by the weight matrices we’ve trained (WQ, WK, WV).\n",

    "The paper further refined the self-attention layer by adding a mechanism called “multi-headed” attention. This improves the performance of the attention layer in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It expands the model’s ability to focus on different positions. If we’re translating a sentence like “The animal didn’t cross the street because it was too tired”, it would be useful to know which word “it” refers to.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It gives the attention layer multiple “representation subspaces”. As we’ll see next, with multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices (the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder). Each of these sets is randomly initialized. Then, after training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](IMG/Multiheadattention.jpg)\n",

    "This leaves us with a bit of a challenge. The feed-forward layer is not expecting eight matrices – it’s expecting a single matrix (a vector for each word). So we need a way to condense these eight down into a single matrix.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Layer normalization, also known as LayerNorm (Ba et al. 2016), centers the activations of a neural network layer around a mean of 0 and normalizes their variance to 1\n",
    "- This stabilizes training and enables faster convergence to effective weights\n",
    "- Layer normalization is applied both before and after the multi-head attention module within the transformer block, which we will implement later; it's also applied before the final output layer\n",

    "\n",
    "- Note that in addition to performing the normalization by subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance, we added two trainable parameters, a scale and a shift parameter\n",
    "- The initial scale (multiplying by 1) and shift (adding 0) values don't have any effect; however, scale and shift are trainable parameters that the LLM automatically adjusts during training if it is determined that doing so would improve the model's performance on its training task\n",
    "- This allows the model to learn appropriate scaling and shifting that best suit the data it is processing\n",
    "Note that we also add a smaller value (eps) before computing the square root of the variance; this is to avoid division-by-zero errors if the variance is 0\n",
    "\n",
    "`Biased variance`\n",

    "- In LLMs, various other types of activation functions are used beyond the traditional ReLU; two notable examples are GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) and SwiGLU (Swish-Gated Linear Unit)\n",
    "- GELU and SwiGLU are more complex, smooth activation functions incorporating Gaussian and sigmoid-gated linear units, respectively, offering better performance for deep learning models, unlike the simpler, piecewise linear function of ReLU\n",
    "GELU (Hendrycks and Gimpel 2016) can be implemented in several ways; the exact version is defined as GELU(x)=x⋅Φ(x), where Φ(x) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard Gaussian distribution.\n",
